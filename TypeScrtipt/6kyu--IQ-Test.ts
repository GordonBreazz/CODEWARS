 *     PLOT: Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to find out which one of the
 *           given numbers differs from the others. Bob observed that one number usually differs from the others in
 *           evenness. Help Bob â€” to check his answers, he needs a program that among the given numbers finds one that
 *           is different in evenness, and return a position of this number.
 *
 *           ! Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test, which means indexes of the elements start from 1 (not 0)
 *
 *           ##Examples :
 *             iqTest("2 4 7 8 10") => 3 // Third number is odd, while the rest of the numbers are even*
 *             iqTest("1 2 1 1") => 2 // Second number is even, while the rest of the numbers are odd
 *
